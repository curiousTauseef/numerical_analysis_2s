## Numerical Analysis 2S

This project was developed wih [Android Studio IDE](https://developer.android.com/studio/). It contains lots of numerical methods about one-variable equations, systems of equations and interpolation. Some of them were implemented with parallel computing. You will be able to found roots in different functions, solve matrixes and find interpolating polynomials.

Mobile application (Android) for the analysis of numerical method. It was developed at EAFIT University, in Medellín, Antioquia, Colombia, designed and implemented in Numerical Analysis, subject of the career Systems Engineering.

## Execution

Download the mobile app in Google Play.

## Test Environment

The application has been tested in Android Studio Emulator.
